# Data Structures & Algorithms

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) form the foundation of computer science and software engineering. Understanding these concepts is crucial for writing efficient code and solving complex problems.

## What Are Data Structures?

Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Different data structures are suited for different kinds of applications.

## What Are Algorithms?

Algorithms are step-by-step procedures for solving problems or performing tasks. They define how to manipulate data structures to achieve desired outcomes.

## Why Learn DSA?

### ðŸŽ¯ **Problem Solving**
- Break down complex problems into manageable parts
- Choose the right approach for different scenarios
- Optimize solutions for better performance

### ðŸ’¼ **Career Growth**
- Essential for technical interviews
- Foundation for system design
- Better code quality and efficiency

### ðŸš€ **Performance**
- Write faster, more efficient code
- Understand time and space complexity
- Scale applications effectively

## Learning Path

### 1. **Data Structures**
Start with fundamental data structures:

- **[Arrays](/dsa/arrays)** - The building blocks
- **[Linked Lists](/dsa/linked-lists)** - Dynamic data organization
- **[Stacks & Queues](/dsa/stacks-queues)** - LIFO and FIFO structures
- **[Trees](/dsa/trees)** - Hierarchical data organization
- **[Graphs](/dsa/graphs)** - Network relationships
- **[Hash Tables](/dsa/hash-tables)** - Fast key-value storage

### 2. **Algorithms**
Master essential algorithms:

- **[Sorting Algorithms](/dsa/sorting-algorithms)** - Organize data efficiently
- **[Searching Algorithms](/dsa/searching-algorithms)** - Find data quickly
- **[Dynamic Programming](/dsa/dynamic-programming)** - Optimize recursive solutions
- **[Greedy Algorithms](/dsa/greedy-algorithms)** - Make locally optimal choices
- **[Graph Algorithms](/dsa/graph-algorithms)** - Navigate complex networks

## Complexity Analysis

Understanding how to analyze algorithm efficiency:

### Time Complexity
How execution time grows with input size:
- **O(1)** - Constant time
- **O(log n)** - Logarithmic time
- **O(n)** - Linear time
- **O(n log n)** - Linearithmic time
- **O(nÂ²)** - Quadratic time

### Space Complexity
How memory usage grows with input size:
```javascript
// O(1) space - constant
function findMax(arr) {
  let max = arr[0];
  for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] > max) max = arr[i];
  }
  return max;
}

// O(n) space - linear
function reverseArray(arr) {
  const reversed = [];
  for (let i = arr.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    reversed.push(arr[i]);
  }
  return reversed;
}
```

## Quick Example: Binary Search

Here's a classic algorithm that demonstrates the power of good data structure choice:

```javascript
// Binary Search - O(log n) time complexity
function binarySearch(sortedArray, target) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = sortedArray.length - 1;
  
  while (left <= right) {
    const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
    
    if (sortedArray[mid] === target) {
      return mid; // Found target
    } else if (sortedArray[mid] < target) {
      left = mid + 1; // Search right half
    } else {
      right = mid - 1; // Search left half
    }
  }
  
  return -1; // Target not found
}

// Usage
const numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15];
console.log(binarySearch(numbers, 7)); // Output: 3
console.log(binarySearch(numbers, 6)); // Output: -1
```

## Practice Strategy

1. **Start with basics** - Understand each data structure thoroughly
2. **Implement from scratch** - Don't just use built-in methods
3. **Analyze complexity** - Always consider time and space trade-offs
4. **Solve problems** - Practice with coding challenges
5. **Compare solutions** - Learn multiple approaches to the same problem

## Common Interview Topics

- Array manipulation and two-pointer techniques
- Linked list operations and cycle detection
- Tree traversals (DFS, BFS)
- Graph algorithms (shortest path, connectivity)
- Dynamic programming patterns
- Sorting and searching optimizations
